# Short Introduction 🤝

My name is [Timothy Enderson](# "This is my chosen name, not my actual one"), and I'm currently interested in **Web Development** (**`Primary Focus`**), in addition to **GoLang** (**`Secondary Focus`**) and countless other things / areas I haven't even heard of yet 🌟.

I'm a curious and motivated learner, always striving to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies 📊.

As I continue my learning journey, I constantly discover new and exciting areas to explore, different perspectives, and approaches to problem-solving 🧠.
This ongoing process allows me to continuously grow and expand my knowledge and skill set 🌱.

## About Me 😃

I’m passionate about so many topics which make it feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface 🌍.
I have a strong foundation in web development, particularly with the important trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
At that point in time during my learning journey, my JavaScript experience relied more on a _learn as you go_ approach.
I’ve also gained a fair understanding of how REST APIs work.

However, I've started my web development journey with PHP 8+, diving deep into its capabilities, including OOP and SQL, with the MVC pattern and XDebug.
On that note, I've also learned why the MVC pattern used to be a good idea and why it's not anymore ⚙️.
I mean separation of concerns has many theoretical benefits, but it features as many practical drawbacks as well.
Anyhow, I’m now shifting my focus toward JavaScript and exploring frameworks with NodeJS.

I’ve also dabbled in Java for a bit, but I have to admit, C# is the language I'm more excited about 🔥.
It’s not that I wouldn’t code in Java, Minecraft makes sure of that, but C# just offers a better developer experience for me.
The language’s explicit nature and powerful features like generics make it a joy to work with.
Plus, C# has made significant strides in cross-platform development. Looking at DotNetCore, as well as you, [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/ "A Cross-Platform UI Toolkit for .NET that sits on top of WPF") 🌐.

While I'm interested in learning GoLang, besides that I wanted to further dive into C#, my current goal is to deepen my JavaScript knowledge and refine [my notes](https://github.com/Neonsy/JavaScript-Note-Collection "JavaScript Note Collection") on the subject 📘.
This way I can dive all the way into Web-Technologies and frameworks, and I'll be able to learn and understand the frameworks I'm interested in.

I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I'm open to new opportunities and challenges 💡.
If you're interested in collaborating, I'd love to hear from you!
